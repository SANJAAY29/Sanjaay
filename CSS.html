        </div>
             
        <h1>Early life:</h1>
           <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father bowl to him.In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli arranged for his son to meet Rajkumar Sharma.Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.
            On 18 December 2006, Kohli's father died due to a cerebral attack.According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.</p>
             <br></div>
        <h2>Playing Style:</h2>
           <P> Kohli possesses technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,and a grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.However, Kohli has a vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.

            Kohli has recognition as a limited-overs batsman.In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7 runs when batting first.He has amassed 27 of his 50 ODI hundreds in run-chases,and holds the record for the most hundreds scored when batting second.In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits.His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success.</P>

                    <p>Debut: Virat Kohli made his IPL debut in 2008 for the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), which bought him for ₹12 lakh. He was relatively new to the limelight at that time, having just started his international career.
                    Initial Role: Kohli played as a middle-order batsman in the early seasons. In the 2008 season, he was a promising but inconsistent performer, with a best score of 48 runs.
                    2009: His performances started improving in 2009, where he played a crucial role in RCB’s run to the finals, though they lost to Deccan Chargers. Kohli’s consistency began to catch the eye of the cricketing world.

                    <p><b>2.Establishing Leadership and Breakout Seasons (2011-2013):</b></p>
                    <p>2011: By 2011, Kohli had cemented his place as a regular in the top order. He became the vice-captain of RCB, and his leadership skills were already evident. His performances were solid, contributing both with the bat and leadership.
                    
                    2013: Kohli’s batting skills were on full display as he scored 634 runs in the season, including five fifties, showing his consistency and adaptability in the format. He was beginning to show why he was one of the premier players in T20 cricket.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>3.Taking Over the Captaincy (2013-2015):</b></p>
                    <p>2013: After the departure of Daniel Vettori, Kohli was made the captain of the Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2013. His leadership skills began to shine, though the team did not manage to win the title in his first season as captain. Kohli's personal form remained strong, with several match-winning innings.
                    
                    2014-2015: Kohli continued to excel with the bat in these years, despite RCB failing to win the title. His consistency with the bat made him one of the most dangerous players in the tournament, and he regularly scored in the 300-500 run range in these seasons. He began to evolve into a captain capable of leading a team with passion and strategy.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>4. Record-Breaking 2016 Season and RCB's Final Appearance:</b></p>

He led RCB to the final of the tournament, though they fell short to Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final.
                    
                    2016 IPL: Kohli’s IPL season was historic for individual achievements—he not only set the record for most runs in a season but also finished with a remarkable average of 81.08 and a strike rate of 152.03.

                    <p><b>5. Continued Consistency but Unsuccessful Campaigns (2017-2020):</b></p>
                    <p>2017: Kohli’s consistency continued as he scored 308 runs, but RCB had a disappointing season and finished outside the playoff spots. Despite his individual brilliance, the team could not find the winning formula.
                    
                    2018-2020: In these seasons, Kohli continued to score heavily, but RCB struggled to make it to the playoffs. His leadership was never in doubt, but RCB's inability to perform as a team meant that they often finished mid-table or lower. In these years, Kohli's individual performances remained one of the few bright spots for RCB, but he was unable to lead them to a title or even a top-four finish.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>6. Leadership Change and New Beginnings (2021-Present):</b></p>

Under his leadership, the team had not managed to win the IPL title, but he remained one of the tournament's top players. In 2021, Kohli’s personal form dipped slightly, and RCB did not make it to the finals again. He scored 405 runs in the season at an average of 28.92.
                    
                    Post-Captaincy: After stepping down as captain, RCB appointed Faf du Plessis as the new captain ahead of the 2022 season. Kohli continued as a key player for the franchise, although the focus was more on him getting back to his peak form.
                    
                    2022-2023: Kohli struggled with his form in 2022, but after the IPL 2022 season, he had a resurgence in international cricket, which also helped him regain his confidence in the IPL. He managed to put up decent performances in 2023, with a return to his vintage batting style.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Key Stats and Achievements in IPL:</b></p>

                    <p>Virat Kohli’s IPL career has been marked by individual brilliance, leadership, and an enduring presence at the top. Despite not winning the IPL title with RCB, Kohli has been an integral figure in the tournament, consistently delivering world-class performances. His record-breaking 2016 season is one of the most memorable campaigns in IPL history, and his dedication to RCB has made him a fan favorite. Even after stepping down as captain, Kohli’s contributions continue to be crucial for the franchise.</p>
                <h5>Personal Life:</h5>
                <p>Kohli's romantic association with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, which commenced in 2013, earned the duo the moniker of "Virushka".During an interview with Graham Bensinger, Kohli divulged that he had encountered Sharma for the first time, when they were both were engaged in a promotional shoot for Clear shampoo.Their union since then has attracted significant media interest.On 11 December 2017, the couple exchanged nuptials in a ceremony held in Florence, Italy.On 11 January 2021, the couple had their first child, a daughter, named Vamika.On 15 February 2024, the couple had a second child, a boy named Akaay.

                    In 2018, Kohli disclosed that he had made the decision to adopt a vegetarian diet in an effort to alleviate the symptoms of a cervical spine issue caused by elevated levels of uric acid. This condition was impacting his finger movements, and thus, affecting his performance as a batsman. He made a conscious effort to abstain from consuming meat, as part of his regimen for maintaining optimal health.He has since clarified that his dietary choices do not align with a vegan lifestyle and he continues to consume dairy products and eggs effectively making what is known in India as an eggetarian.His hard work and discipline have earned him the reputation of being one of the fittest cricketers in the world.
                    
                    Kohli has acknowledged a belief in superstitions and owns various lucky charms and rituals that he feels serve to bring him good fortune on the cricket field. One such tradition involves the donning of black wristband. Additionally, he prefers a particular pair of gloves, which he has consistently worn.Furthermore, Kohli has been observed sporting a kara, a traditional bangle often worn for religious or spiritual purposes, on his right arm since 2012.In addition to the previously mentioned superstitions, Kohli has also established the ritual of consistently donning white shoes on the cricket field.Kohli has tattoos of the Hindu deity Lord Shiva, the sacred syllable "Om", the names of his parents, Prem and Saroj, a tribal emblem, a representation of a serene monastery, a samurai warrior, the astrological symbol of the scorpion, and his ODl and Test match cap numbers.</p>
                <h6>Outside Cricket:</h6>
                <p>Kohli invested in Indian Super League club FC Goa, which he co-owned as of 2024. Beyond the realm of cricket, this venture served as a future business opportunity for him, as he sought to diversify his portfolio after retirement from the sport. In November 2014, Kohli partnered with Anjana Reddy's Universal Sportsbiz (USPL) to launch the youth fashion brand WROGN. The brand specialized in men's casual wear clothing and entered into collaborations with retail outlets such as Myntra and Shopper's Stop.Additionally, in late 2014, Kohli became a shareholder and brand ambassador for the London-based social networking venture "Sport Convo". His involvement aimed to promote and raise awareness of the platform, which was focused on providing a space for sports fans to connect and engage with one another.
